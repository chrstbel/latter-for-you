# My Beloved blue,

thank you for always being there for me, always willing to be with me, always trying again and again. 

i don't know what to say other than thank you, you are always perfect in my eyes, always cool, always my inspiration, you are my daily encouragement. 

thank you for being born in this world, i hope you feel the same way about me. 

sorry i should have given you real flowers, but this is all i can give you. hopefully someday, i can give flowers to you in person. 

happy valentine! i love you, always.

Always Yours,

bel.
